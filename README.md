## PROBLEM

Consider this request for statistics.

```bash
curl 'https://admin-test.bx-cloud.com/winp/data/v2/admin/audiences/temp-stats' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \

  -H 'Referer: http://0.0.0.0:9000/' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site' \

  --data-raw '[{"audience_id":"3e32677f-85c8-19a5-72a6-f98ea990e062","name":"collection audience Aug 11","description":"A test collection audience","rule_groups":[{"rules":[{"type":"093877fd-4a8e-fbe7-c9f2-b1a61649f377","operator":"affinity_over","value":"wishlist","field":"collection_093877fd-4a8e-fbe7-c9f2-b1a61649f377","weight":0.6,"comment":"comment here"},{"type":"singlebrand_buyer_v1","operator":"is true","value":"true","field":"order","weight":0.42,"comment":"purchased 3 times"},{"type":"category_order_count_last_x_days_v1","operator":"greater than","value":"{\"category\":\"category-C\",\"days\":\"56\"}","field":"order","weight":1,"comment":""}],"logical_operator":"OR"},{"rules":[{"type":"first_order_date_v1","operator":"greater than","value":"2025-08-21","field":"order","weight":1,"comment":""}],"logical_operator":"AND"}],"logical_operator":"OR","created_at":"2025-08-11T09:41:44.866Z","updated_at":"2025-08-18T13:36:13.310Z","is_deleted":false,"parent_audience_id":null,"group_name":null,"priority":null,"last_action_by":null}]'
```

The third rule of filter type `category_order_count_last_x_days_v1` in the `first` rule group's rules has a json structure for the rule's `value` property that is corresponding to the filter type's `value_type` i.e:

```json
{
  "accounts": [],
  "type_id": "category_order_count_last_x_days_v1",
  "type": "order",
  "display_name": "Orders from Category in Last x Days",
  "description": "Enter days; counts orders from the category within that period (format: \"CATEGORY,DAYS\")",
  "value_type": "[{\"type\":\"string\",\"label\":\"category\",\"description\":\"Category identifier\"},{\"type\":\"number\",\"label\":\"days\",\"description\":\"Number of days\"}]",
  "allowed_operators": [
    "less than",
    "greater than",
    "less than or equal to",
    "greater than or equal to"
  ],
  "possible_values": [],
  "is_required": false,
  "created_at": "2025-05-22 14:08:18.683932+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2025-05-22 14:08:18.683932+00:00",
  "is_deleted": false
}
```

The new approach I gave it was to instead of storing a comma delimited list of values (for the json value types defined by corresponding `FilterTypes`) in the same `value` property of a `Rule`, am storing a json string instead with keys identical to `label`'s values. i.e  
given the above `Filter Type` the value property of a `Rule` of this type becomes:

```json
{
  "type": "category_order_count_last_x_days_v1",
  "operator": "greater than",
  "value": "{\"category\":\"category-C\",\"days\":\"56\"}",
  "field": "order",
  "weight": 1,
  "comment": ""
}
```

I feel this is a better way storing the values in a `stringified map` instead of `a comma delimited list of values`.

## CHALLENGE

The challenge am facing now is with fetching the statistics as it does not seem to recognize this format depicted by this response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "code": 200,
  "payload": [
    {
      "error": "An internal error occurred: Invalid JSON in audience_param when use_temp_audience=True: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 561 (char 560)"
    }
  ],
  "tm": "20250820053724",
  "errors": []
}
```

## OBSERVATIONS

- Fetching any audience statistics that does not include a rule with such complex values is a success considering the `value` properties are plain strings.
- Resending the failing request with the `culprit rule`'s value transformed to a comma delimited list is also a success: i.e `"value":"category-C,56"`

```bash
curl 'https://admin-test.bx-cloud.com/winp/data/v2/admin/audiences/temp-stats' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
  -H 'Origin: http://0.0.0.0:9000' \
  -H 'Referer: http://0.0.0.0:9000/' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site' \

  -H 'sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0' \
  -H 'sec-ch-ua-platform: "Linux"' \
  --data-raw '[{"audience_id":"3e32677f-85c8-19a5-72a6-f98ea990e062","name":"collection audience Aug 11","description":"A test collection audience","rule_groups":[{"rules":[{"type":"093877fd-4a8e-fbe7-c9f2-b1a61649f377","operator":"affinity_over","value":"wishlist","field":"collection_093877fd-4a8e-fbe7-c9f2-b1a61649f377","weight":0.6,"comment":"comment here"},{"type":"singlebrand_buyer_v1","operator":"is true","value":"true","field":"order","weight":0.42,"comment":"purchased 3 times"},{"type":"category_order_count_last_x_days_v1","operator":"greater than","value":"category-C,56","field":"order","weight":1,"comment":""}],"logical_operator":"OR"},{"rules":[{"type":"first_order_date_v1","operator":"greater than","value":"2025-08-21","field":"order","weight":1,"comment":""}],"logical_operator":"AND"}],"logical_operator":"OR","created_at":"2025-08-11T09:41:44.866Z","updated_at":"2025-08-18T13:36:13.310Z","is_deleted":false,"parent_audience_id":null,"group_name":null,"priority":null,"last_action_by":null}]'
```

## REQUEST

The approach I gave the json values gives me a flexible way of transforming the values consistently, it only fails when fetching statistics. I dont know how flexible this can be adjusted to adapt my approach (that is from a comma delimited list to a json string) so that fetching statistics do not fail.
